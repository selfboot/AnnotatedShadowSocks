Annotated Shadowsocks
=====================

[Shadowsocks][Shadowsocks] is a fast tunnel proxy that helps you bypass firewalls.  It's very very cool and helpful.  But how is it going? What is the magic?

I'd like to read the code line by line, version by version, and have some notes at the same time.  I would write some comments in the source code, propose some issues to record the skill, and create some WIKI to make the code more clear.
